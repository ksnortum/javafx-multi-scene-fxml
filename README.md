# javafx-multi-scene-fxml
**javafx-multi-scene-fxml** is a demonstration how you can use one stage and many scenes when building a JavaFX application using FXML files.  The graphics are very simple, as the point of the demo is how to move from one to the other.  

## Intro
**javafx-multi-scene-fxml** uses a static Map in Main with FxmlInfo as the value and the SceneName as the key.  SceneName is an enum with the name of each Scene.  FxmlInfo is a class that holds all the data needed to load an FXML file into a Scene and holds that Scene once it's loaded.

Scenes are loaded lazily, that is, only when needed.  A Scene is built the first, then all subsequent calls load the built Scene.

The Stage is injected from Main into each View and from there into each controller.  This combination of FxmlInfo Map and Stage provides all the control need for each Scene.

## Requirements
**javafx-multi-scene** will run on Java 8 or above.

## Launching
Launch **javafx-multi-scene** from your favorite IDE, or with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

    mvn compile exec:java

## What to notice
When the application launches, you are presented to the main view, with buttons for three separate scenes and a close button.  Press a scene button and you will go to one of three different scenes.  Each scene also has a close button, which is possible because the stage from Main is injected into each.  

## Bugs, improvements
 - There is a bug in JavaFX such that you must put the FXML files in the same package as the controllers.
